# Evolution Simulation


This app simulates an ecosystem with several different species.
The species survive by consuming water and food, either from the world or from other species. They have a homebase and will protect it at all costs. They can build barriers with the resources they find in the world, create packs of soliders that protect their homebase, or start an offensive to eliminate the other species.

One of the goals is to watch the species develop emergent behaviors from the simple rules that they possess. We can watch why some species survive and prosper, and why other species are killed off. 


 *Features:*
- Species AI to gather food, resources, build defenses, and fight other species
