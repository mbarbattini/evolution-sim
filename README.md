# Evolution Simulation


This is a project that simulates an ecosystem with several different species.
The species survive by consuming energy, either from the world or from other species.
The goal is to observe the species develop emergent behaviors from the simple rules that they possess. We can watch how and why some species survive and prosper, and how other species are killed off. 


 *Features:*
- Genetic algoirithms control how the species reproduce
- Species AI to gather food, resources, build defenses, and fight other species
